## Requirements

Before installing etcd, see the following pages:

- [Supported platforms][]
- [Hardware recommendations][]

## Install pre-built binaries

The easiest way to install etcd is from pre-built binaries:

 1. Download the compressed archive file for your platform from [Releases][],
    choosing release [{{< param git_version_tag >}}][tagged-release] or later.
 2. Unpack the archive file. This results in a directory containing the binaries.
 3. Add the executable binaries to your path. For example, rename and/or move
    the binaries to a directory in your path (like `/usr/local/bin`), or add the
    directory created by the previous step to your path.
 4. From a shell, test that `etcd` is in your path:

    ```sh
    $ etcd --version
    etcd Version: {{< psubstr git_version_tag 1 >}}
    ...
    ```

## Build from source

If you have [Go version {{< param minGoVers >}}+][go], you can build etcd from
source by following these steps:

 1. [Download the etcd repo as a zip file][download] and unzip it, or clone the
    repo using the following command.

    ```sh
    $ git clone -b {{< param git_version_tag >}} https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd.git
    ```
    To build from `{{< param github_branch >}}@HEAD`, omit the `-b  {{< param
    git_version_tag >}}` flag.

 2. Change directory:

    ```sh
    $ cd etcd
    ```
 3. Run the build script:

    ```sh
    $ ./scripts/build.sh
    ```

    The binaries are under the `bin` directory.

 4. Add the full path to the `bin` directory to your path, for example:

    ```sh
    $ export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`/bin"
    ```

 5. Test that `etcd` is in your path:

    ```sh
    $ etcd --version
    ```

## Installation via OS packages
*Disclaimer: etcd installations through OS package managers can deliver outdated versions since they are not being automatically maintained nor officially supported by etcd project. Therefore use OS packages with caution.*

There are various ways of installing etcd on different operating systems and these are just some examples how it can be done.

### MacOS (Homebrew)

1. Update homebrew:
```sh
$ brew update
```

2. Install etcd:
```sh
$ brew install etcd
```

3. Verify install
```sh
$ etcd --version
```

## Linux

Although it is possible to install etcd through many major Linux distribution's official repositories and package managers, the versions published are significantly outdated. So, installing this way is strongly discouraged.

The following package managers are community maintained and have the most up-to-date version:

### Homebrew on Linux

[Homebrew can run on Linux], and can provide recent software versions.

- Prerequisites
  - Update Homebrew:

    ```sh
    $ brew update
    ```
- Procedure
  - Install using `brew`:

    ```sh
    $ brew install etcd
    ```
- Result
  - Verify installation by getting the version:

    ```sh
    $ etcd --version
    etcd Version: {{< psubstr git_version_tag 1 >}}
    ...
    ```

### Alpine Linux

Alpine Linux provides two separate packages: `etcd` and `etcd-ctl`. They are in the testing repository, so you must enable it before installing.

- Prerequisites
  - Enable testing repository:

    ```sh
    $ echo 'https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/edge/testing/' | sudo tee -a /etc/apk/repositories
    # or if you're running as root:
    $ echo 'https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/edge/testing/' >> /etc/apk/repositories
    ```
- Procedure
  - Install using apk:

    ```sh
    $ sudo apk add etcd etcd-ctl
    # or if you're running as root:
    $ apk add etcd etcd-ctl
    ```
- Result
  - Verify installation by getting the version:

    ```sh
    $ etcd --version
    etcd Version: {{< psubstr git_version_tag 1 >}}
    ...
    ```

### ArchLinux (AUR)

The [Arch User Repository (AUR)] keeps an up-to-date version.

- Prerequisites
  - Ensure you have installed the `base-devel` package:

    ```sh
    $ sudo pacman -S base-devel
    ```

  - Fetch the most recent snapshot by going to <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/etcd>
  - Extract the downloaded tar.gz file:

    ```sh
    $ tar -zxf etcd.tar.gz
    ```

  - Change the working directory:

    ```sh
    $ cd etcd
    ```
- Procedure
  - Run `makepkg`:

    ```sh
    $ makepkg -s
    ```

  - Install the generated pkg file:

    ```sh
    $ sudo pacman -U etcd-*.pkg.tar.zst
    ```
- Result
  - Verify installation by getting the version:

    ```sh
    $ etcd --version
    etcd Version: {{< psubstr git_version_tag 1 >}}
    ...
    ```

### ALT Linux Sisyphus

ALT Linux Sisyphus maintains an up-to-date version.

- Prerequisites
  - Update apt repository

    ```sh
    $ sudo apt-get update
    ```
- Procedure
  - Install using `apt-get`:

    ```sh
    $ sudo apt-get install etcd
    ```
- Result
  - Verify installation by getting the vesion:

    ```sh
    $ etcd --version
    etcd Version: {{< psubstr git_version_tag 1 >}}
    ...
    ```

## Installation as part of Kubernetes installation

TBD---Help Wanted

## Installation on Kubernetes, using a statefulset or helm chart

The etcd project does not currently maintain a helm chart, however you can follow the instructions provided by [Bitnami's etcd Helm chart].

## Installation check

For a slightly more involved sanity check of your installation, see
[Quickstart][].
